Fork + Clone: keeping our own copy of the files on our computer. Fork: own copy; Clone: own copy on MY computer. Helps work even without internet.
Commit: A bank! Make as many as you want. Used to save codes/files. Have several checkpoints, which can be re-visited to undo any errors if present.
Push + Pull: New code on the server is either Pushed to the cimputer or Pulled to us. Helps send changes across to other developers. Google drive for code.
Branch: a similar entity of fork. Branch your own copy, make changes and then merge it back to the original file.
Merge + Rebase + Squash: To help merge the branch onto the mail file. A squash merge says, irrepective of the number of bankings, it is going to consider only one time point.
Pull Request + Merge Request: a control/processing place to check code.
